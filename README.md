# Signal Sciences TA for Splunk App

This app for Splunk connects to the Signal Sciences API in order to pull data into Splunk. 

## Signal Sciences REST API Endpoints used

1. https://dashboard.signalsciences.net/api/v0/auth *(Only used if using Password authentication instead of APITokens)*
2. https://dashboard.signalsciences.net/api/v0/corps/{{corp}}/sites/{{site}}/analytics/events
2. https://dashboard.signalsciences.net/api/v0/corps/{{corp}}/sites/{{site}}/feed/requests
3. https://dashboard.signalsciences.net/api/v0/corps/{{corp}}/activity


## Where to get API Information?

The Corp name and Dashboard Site names are in the URL for the dashboard. For example if we had a Corp Name of `foo` and a Dashboard Site name of `bar` we would see it like the following:

`https://dashboard.signalsciences.net/corps/foo/sites/bar`

You can also get the API Name for Dashboard Sites from the Manage Sites menu if you are a Corp Owner or Corp Admin. When logging into the Signal Sciences Dashboard you can go to `Corp Tools` -> `Manage Sites` and the lowercase name under the display name is the API Name.

In versions 1.0.17+ you can use API Tokens instead of using a password. If both the password and API Token fields are filled in the App will use the API Token field and the password will be ignored. One of these are required.

Information about API Tokens can be found at https://docs.signalsciences.net/developer/using-our-api/

## Indexes

The Technical Adapter does not create an index by default. The Data inputs do default to an index named `sigsci`. If this index does not exist you will either need to create it or in the more settings of the data inputs specify an index that does exist.

3. Click on "Configuration"
4. Click on "Add-on Settings"
5. Fill in the Signal Sciences user (Email Address), Password or API Token, and the Singal Sicences corp name.

   * **Email Address:** This is the username/email address for the Signal Sciences dashboard
   * **Password:** This is only required if you are **not using** an API Token
   * **API Token:** Required if you are **not using** your password
   * **Corp Name** This is the API id for the corp, often if your Display Name for the corp is "Corp ABC" the API Name might be something like `corp-abc`

9. Chose either "Sigsci Requests" or "Sigsci Event"
10. Fill in the Input settings

    * **Name:** This is the unique name you would like to give the input
    * **index:** This can be any index you recommend, I generally will do a custom index that I create called `sigsci`
    * **Delta:** This is the time period, in minutes, that the script will pull. This should generally be left at the default which is 5 and matches the interval for the input. This is in minutes 5 = 300 seconds.
    * **Interval:** This is the interval frequency the script runs in, in minutes. This should be the same as the delta and is recommended to leave at 300 (5 minutes)
    * **Dashboared Site Name:** This is the API Name for the dashboard it could be something like `app-prod`
